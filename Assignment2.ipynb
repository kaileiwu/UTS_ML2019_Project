    "Nowadays, more and more activity recognition-based machine learning has been studied, especially in human physical activity recognition. The progress in this direction is surprisingly good. Models can recognize simple human exercises, such as walking, running or standing, count steps and detect a general overarching activity. However, it is hard to apply in a specific domain such as healthcare. There are mainly for two reasons: the activities themselves are more complex, potentially involving other subjects, and additionally harder to analyze because of the lack of public data that can be used within the research. In this report, we create a machine learning (ML) model regarding the \"Open Lab Nursing Activity Recognition Challenge\", which asks to recognize six different activities within the nursing area (Lago et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, many activity recognition algorithms in health care applications are focusing on patients or doctors rather than nurses. However, the recognition of nursing activities can be helpful in the nursing domain, such as for automatic record creation and standardization of operation supervision. Until now, there is still a gap for ML models to recognize nursing-related activities due to the problems that we mentioned before. The applications of such a model would be wide-spread and of high impact in the nursing area, given the model achieves an exceptional accuracy in prediction."
